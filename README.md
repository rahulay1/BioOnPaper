This project combines face biometric and AES encryption to generate QR code based access token to link physical identities in digital domain.

Why?
Many governments, companies and institutes are still using photo cards to verify their citizens, customers, employees, and users. The photo cards were introduced in the 1900s and require manual verification. Moreover, human errors lead to identity theft and fraud. To automate the 100 years old photo cards, we are introducing BioOnPaper, which a deep neural network and advanced encryption-based software. BioOnPaper offers high accuracy, fast, reliability, and cheap to produce.
